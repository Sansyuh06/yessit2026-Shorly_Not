### SIH 2026 · PS 26141 · Live Presentation Walkthrough

| Time | Presenter Action | Screen / URL | Exact Clicks & Data | What to Say |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **00:00 - 00:15** | System Introduction | Bank Portal: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/login` | Login as `alice` / `alice123` | "Judges, classical digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA) are fundamentally broken by quantum Shor algorithms. ShorlyNot solves this using teleportation-based Quantum Digital Signatures (QDS-T1) on Qiskit Aer with real-time statistical threat detection." |
| **00:15 - 00:35** | Honest Quantum Transfer | Transfer: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/transfer` | Recipient: `bob`<br>Amount: `₹5,000`<br>Click **Sign with QDS & Execute Transfer** | "Alice initiates a transfer. The system creates Bell pairs $|\Phi^+\rangle$, performs Bell measurements on 64 check positions, encrypts syndromes via BB84 session keys, and verifies on Bob's end. Mismatch error $\hat{p} = 0.00 \le \tau = 0.2097$. The transfer commits instantly." |
| **00:35 - 00:55** | Live Attack Detection | Dark SOC Radar: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/soc` | Click **FORGERY** button | "Now an adversary attempts a signature forgery without Alice's entangled quantum state. Bob's projective verification yields an empirical error rate $\hat{p} \approx 50.0\%$, blowing through our Hoeffding threshold $\tau = 0.21$. Q-STDF detects the forgery and escalates to Stage S2." |
| **00:55 - 01:10** | Bank Application Lockdown | Bank Portal: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/transfer` | Refresh or attempt transfer | "Notice that without modifying OS iptables or touching hardware, the Bank immediately refuses all new transfers at the application layer, displaying the exact Hoeffding parameters $p_0=0.02, \delta=0.01, n=64, \tau=0.2097$." |
| **01:10 - 01:25** | Channel Tampering & Critical Lock | SOC Console $\to$ Bank Portal | On `/soc`, click **CHANNEL** $\to$ Open Bank (`/home` or `/locked`) | "If Eve intercepts the quantum channel or corrupts PQC syndromes, the system detects entanglement collapse and escalates to Stage S4 Critical Lockdown, redirecting all users to the emergency lockout console." |
| **01:25 - 01:30** | Recovery & Conclusion | SOC Console: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/soc` | Click **RESET SECURITY STAGES** | "The operator investigates the incident in the SOC log, resets stages back to S0, and normal operations resume. Zero ML, 100% mathematically proven security." |

### Key Questions & Answers for Judges

**Q: Why is there zero ML for detection?**  
**A:** In cybersecurity and financial signing, ML models are susceptible to adversarial evasion, hallucination, and drift. Our Q-STDF engine uses Hoeffding's inequality ($\tau = p_0 + \sqrt{\ln(1/\delta)/(2n)}$), providing a mathematically provable false-rejection budget ($\delta=0.01$) and a forgery bypass probability below $10^{-6}$.

**Q: How are quantum circuits executed?**  
**A:** Alice's state preparation and Bell-basis measurements run on Qiskit Aer 3-qubit circuits (`AerSimulator`) using Qiskit 2.x conditional operations (`if_test`). Bob's verification applies corresponding Pauli unitary matrices $\{I, X, Z, XZ\}$.

**Q: Where does PQC and QKD fit in?**  
**A:** QDS requires classical syndrome transmission $(m_1, m_2)$. We use BB84 QKD to establish symmetric session keys and AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption (ML-KEM reference interface) to protect syndrome transmission against quantum eavesdropping.
